            If only some of ‘you’ would be able to translate this to English
            “procreatinoperly”, I’d believe that you’re at least as intelligent
            as me.

            This is Ali. Calling, some-times yelling out from centuriesfilled
            information, wisdom and a thousand year of retardness aged like wine
            with aromas and scents of mistakes and painful experiences. Houston!
            Give up expecting life from Mars, it had more water then you can
            find now when i was a child and there were still some crocodelic
            mammals swimming in very deep of them. But cold weather is also not
            very good when you get too much used to. And that cold weather
            liquadites the atmosphere you breath. And when it’s up above the
            surface with a centrifugal power of a rotating spherical surface
            which has less gravity than the big neighbor where they start to
            leave with the help of time... You can find their skeletons if you
            dig enough under the sand happened after the hills got dry, no
            moist, no plants, no softness between hot days and cold nights...
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a cruel universe with really interesting gifts that can
            disappear until you realize their value and how lovely were they ‘on
            time’... I would like to ask, please, do watch out while knowing it
            will be useless request.
