          If only some of ‘you’ would be able to translate this to English
          “procreatinoperly”, I’d believe that you’re at least as intelligent as
          me.

          This is Ali. Calling, some-times yelling out from centuriesfilled
          information, wisdom and a thousand year of retardness aged like wine
          with aromas and scents of mistakes and painful experiences. Houston!
          Give up expecting life from Mars, it had more water then you can find
          now when i was a child and there were still some crocodelic mammals
          swimming in very deep of them. But cold weather is also not very good
          when you get too much used to. And that cold weather liquadites the
          atmosphere you breath. And when it’s up above the surface with a
          centrifugal power of a rotating spherical surface which has less
          gravity than the big neighbor where they start to leave with the help
          of time... You can find their skeletons if you dig enough under the
          sand happened after the hills got dry, no moist, no plants, no
          softness between hot days and cold nights...

          This is a cruel universe with really interesting gifts that can
          disappear until you realize their value and how lovely were they ‘on
          time’... I would like to ask, please, do watch out while knowing it
          will be useless request.
